Notes:

Changes to code:
* IterationLC jobs in Iteration to -1
* Change output to /reports


Plan:
1) Alter the code so that it will run
2) . Alter Makefile to Run Code. One for each script and one for all of them at once.
3) Work through the results of each one
4) Go hard on the analysis. Explain every hyper param. Graph in Notebooks and Export to PDF
5) Cut down to 12 pages
